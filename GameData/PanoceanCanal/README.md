Panocean Canal - A canal that links the oceans and allows naval circumnavigation of stock Kerbin.

The mod only provides configuration files for other mods. It makes no modification to these other mods original assets or functions. 
You must acquire and install these mods for your own personal use and must abide by the terms of their licences.  

This mod **requires** the following to work;

- **Kerbal Konstructs**
- **Kerbin Side Core** (this is part of the old Kerbin Side containing only statics available on CKAN, ** DO NOT USE  Kerbin Side Complete ** )
- **Omega's Stockalike Structures: No Textures Required**

It is compatible with Kerbin Side Remastered and associated mods. 

This mod has been built and tested in KSP 1.11.2. It should function in KSP 1.12.x, however I have not tested it, and sometimes KK map-decals to not translate correctly.
